# Variance
- Welford's is the most numerically stable method which is important if we have lots of values with very little deviation.
    - this can lead to catastrophic cancellation
- Running variance:
    - data comes in continuously and with time, the calculation memory need increases
    - with a recursive calculation of mean and variance this does not need to be so
    - nonetheless, the recursive (time) measures has a long memory and follow fluctuations only slowly

# Recursion
- Randow walk by recursion material
- Problem solving book
- Recurstive programming book
- Remaining recursion material

# Past RW examples
- ant
    - probability grid
    - D grid
    - max probability grid
    - bootstrap
    - other optimization?

# Reading
- Review for the lost notes
    - Simulation
    - Monte carlo
    - Bootstrap
- Things from the net

# After this
- Heroku + Flask
- Scraping
