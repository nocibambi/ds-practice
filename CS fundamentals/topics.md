# Monday
~~1. Do the CS examples~~
~~2. get timeit work (Ramalho?, McKinney?)~~
3. Transform my old randow walks into vectorized form
4. Go through the Brownlee book~~
~~5. Download what I need~~

- Vectorized linear algebra (Brownlee, Klein)
    - Dot product (Brownlee)
    - BLAS, LAPACK ()
    - numerical computation with
        - numpy (Brownlee, Rougier)
        - scipy ?

- Simulation
    - Random walks (notes, McKinney)
    - Probability distributions, variance (Blais)
