# Proposed way to work with each week's materials.

1. Read the lecture summaries after the videos.
2. Read the week's Lecture notes and the Errata under the 'Resources' menu
3. Do the quizes for each under the week's videos.
4. Start to solve the exercise from the end of the week's lectures.
    1. Before each part, read and practice the Tutorials accessed from the 'Resources' menu 'Tutorials' page.
    2. After solving the exercise parts also run them with the test cases
    3. In case you really do not understand something, watch corresponding lecture.
