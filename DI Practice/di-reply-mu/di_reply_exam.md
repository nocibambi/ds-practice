# Exam procedure
Duration of the test. Once you receive the test, you will have
* 30 minutes for preparation (e.g., downloading the file, printing the file, reading the exam)
* 2 hours to solve it (in paper or electronic)
* 30 minutes to prepare and send your solutions
Under no circumstances an exam will be accepted after 3 hours of having been sent. Use your time wisely. Note: you can also use your cellphone to “scan” your answers if the quality of the images is good.

# Guidelines
* explain how you solved the exercises, show your work, justify the answer
* programming
    - use Python
    - avoid importing additional libraries
    - look for the optimal solution in terms of time complexity and memory usage. In case one of them is compromised by the other, select one and explain for which cases the other aspect might have problems.
* submission format
    - submit in pdf file
    - please begin every page with your name and the exercise number
    - do not mix several exercises in the same page, i.e. one page per exercise.
