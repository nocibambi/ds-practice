# Standard deviation of measure averages
# All measure performance rates are on a 0 to 100 scale. Compute the average
# measure performance rate for each clinician (across all measures).
# Consider the distribution of these average rates for individuals who have at
# least 10. What is the standard deviation of that distribution?

## Concatenating the two performance tables
permen = pd.concat([ind, perf], join = 'inner')
permen.rename(columns = {"PAC ID" : "PACID",
                         "Measure Identifier": "MesId",
                         "Inverse Measure": "InvMe",
                         "Measure Performance Rate" : "MPR"}, 
             inplace = True)

## Finding the inverse measures and turning them into negative values
permen['MPR'] = permen['MPR'].where(permen['InvMe'] == 'N', -permen['MPR'])

## Filtering the data
sample = permen.groupby(by = 'PACID').mean()[(permen.groupby(by = 'PACID').count()['MPR'] >= 10)]
sample.describe()['MPR']['std']
## The is standard deviation is 21.59552465837087

# Performance difference between MDs and NPs
## What is the absolute difference in the average performance rates between doctors (MD) and nurse practitioners (NP)? For each clinician, use his or her average performance rates across all measures. Furthermore, only consider individuals who have at least 10 rates.
nat.rename(columns = {'PAC ID' : 'PACID'}, inplace = True)
credper = pd.merge(sample, nat[['PACID', 'Credential']], how = 'left', left_index = True, right_on = 'PACID')

credperme = credper.groupby(by= 'Credential').mean()
abs(credperme['MPR']['MD'] - credperme['MPR']['NP'])
## The absolute difference between MD and NP performance means is 7.3000968904461132`

# Performance rates vs. graduation year
## What is the p-value of the linear regression of performance rates vs. graduation year? Consider the average performance rates (across all measures) of every doctor (MD) who graduated between 1973 and 2003 (inclusive). Only consider doctors who have at least 10 rates. For each graduation year, compute the mean of these rates. Assuming the relationship between graduation year and performance rates is linear, find the slope and determine if the relationship is significant. Return the p-value of the linear regression.
nat.rename(columns = {"Graduation Year": "GradYr"}, inplace = True)
mdper = pd.merge(permen, nat[['PACID', 'Credential', 'GradYr']]), on = 'PACID', how = 'left')
